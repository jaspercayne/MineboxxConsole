# MineboxxConsole
A custom built Minecraft server administration console

This repository contains the web application used to administer a Mineboxx virtual machine.
This web app will only function correctly on a Mineboxx server and should not be used in other instances without heavy alteration.

NOTE:
This readme will be added to as time allows, but the current focus is on development.
